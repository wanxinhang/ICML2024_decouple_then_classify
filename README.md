The code of ICML 2024 ''Decouple then Classify: A Dynamic Multi-view Labeling Strategy with Shared and Specific Information''
Nota that the PDF file is a temporary version, not the final version

the output file:
dataset_doc.txt: document the trainging process of each dataset. for instance:test:[0.05, 0.33125, 0.33125, 0.33125] indicates when the label is 0.5, the acc results on test set are 0.331255，0.33125，0.33125 (our results and the results merely utilizing shared/specific information)
datasets.txt: preserve the average and std results  (our results and the results merely utilizing shared/specific information)
